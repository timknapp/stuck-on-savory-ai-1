        <p>Smoky BBQ Ribs are a classic barbecue favorite that are tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The homemade smoky rub and tangy barbecue sauce make these ribs a hit at any cookout or family gathering.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 racks of baby back ribs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground cumin, black pepper, and salt to create the dry rub.</li>
            <li>Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs and rub the dry rub mixture evenly onto both sides of the ribs.</li>
            <li>Wrap the ribs in aluminum foil and let them marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill to medium-low heat. Place the foil-wrapped ribs on the grill, bone side down, and cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily pulls away from the bone.</li>
            <li>Remove the ribs from the foil and brush both sides with barbecue sauce. Grill the ribs for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce is caramelized and sticky.</li>
            <li>Remove the ribs from the grill, let them rest for a few minutes, and then cut into individual ribs. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
